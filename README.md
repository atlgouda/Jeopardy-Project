## Old School Rap Themed Jeopardy Game

## Inspiration:
Some of my favorite viral clips from Jeopardy are when Alex Trebek reads the clues from a rap category.  I used this as an inspiration to make my Old School Rap game.  Click on the link below for an example!

## Overview:

Once users come to the site the game board will load.  The player then can choose from 9 different questions over 3 categories.  The player will select a square, and then a multiple choice question will display.  As they answer questions correctly, the corresponding point total will be added to their scoreboard.  The game ends when either the player reaches 100 points, or there are no more tiles to select.  If a player would like to reset the game at any point, they can click the reset function.
